# Nova-IDE Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the Nova-IDE design into a series of actionable coding tasks that will build the Universal AI Orchestration Layer and integrate it with VOID IDE patterns. Each task is designed to be executed incrementally, building upon previous work while maintaining a testable and functional system at each stage.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each task builds incrementally on previous work with universal model support from the start
- Maintain a working system at each stage with comprehensive testing across all model types
- Prioritize core AI orchestration capabilities that work universally before advanced features
- Use test-driven development for critical AI integration components with multi-model test scenarios
- Follow Goose architecture patterns for tool integration and MCP protocol implementation

### Quality Assurance
- Every task includes specific test requirements for API, local, and cloud model scenarios
- AI response quality validation is integrated throughout with model-agnostic assessment
- Performance benchmarks are established for different model types and deployment methods
- Security considerations are built into each component with special focus on local/cloud hybrid setups
- MCP integration follows security best practices from Goose implementation patterns

### Integration Strategy
- VOID IDE patterns are preserved and enhanced with universal autopilot functionality
- New autopilot functionality integrates seamlessly with existing VOID IDE model switching
- Universal model support maintains backward compatibility while adding autonomous capabilities
- MCP layer integration follows Goose patterns for comprehensive tool ecosystem support
- Extension system allows for future enhancements and customization with MCP tool integration
- Architecture supports the missing agent functionality that VOID IDE lacks while preserving all existing capabilities

### Universal Autopilot Implementation Notes
- Autopilot mode must work identically across OpenRouter free models, local Ollama models, and cloud-deployed models
- Model switching during autopilot execution should be seamless and maintain task context
- Cost optimization prioritizes free OpenRouter models and local models over paid APIs
- Tool calling abstraction adapts to model capabilities (structured prompting vs function calling vs API integration)
- MCP integration enables comprehensive tool ecosystem access regardless of underlying model type
