# Nova-IDE Requirements Document

## Introduction

Nova-IDE is an advanced AI-powered Integrated Development Environment designed to provide Claude 4.1-style agentic capabilities with support for multiple AI providers (cloud and local). The IDE will feature a sophisticated AI orchestration layer that acts as a senior developer assistant, capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex development tasks through a dynamic tool ecosystem.

The system will be built at `C:\Users\System777\Downloads\IDE\Final IDE\Nova-IDE` using the existing codebases from Void IDE, VS Code, and other advanced AI IDE implementations as reference. The architecture will follow Kiro IDE patterns and best practices (https://kiro.dev/docs/getting-started/) while creating a future-proof development environment suitable for both personal use and commercial deployment with open-source LLMs on cloud infrastructure.

## Requirements

3. WHEN orchestrating agents THEN the system SHALL assign specialized roles (planner, coder, reviewer, debugger) to different models based on their strengths and availability
4. WHEN implementing reasoning loops THEN the system SHALL create ReAct-style patterns (Reason → Act → Observe) that work with any model, not just premium ones
